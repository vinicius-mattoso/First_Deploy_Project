# First_Deploy_Project

This is my first Deploy project of machine Learning.
In this repository will apear the data base of diabetes patients from the final project of the IGTI Machine Learning Bootcamp  combined with the knowledge from the IGIT Python Developer BootCamp.

# First part of this repository

I will use three methods to characterize the pacientes, and evaluate with is the best to this characterize.

# Test

I have already tested to make a rebalance into the data base, to see if there is a big upgrade into the model.

# Final part of this repository

I create a Flask app to run the model and use into a local host to evaluate the characteristics of new patients.
